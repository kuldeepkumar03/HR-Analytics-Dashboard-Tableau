# HR Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains a Tableau project focused on analyzing various HR metrics. The dashboard visualizes employee demographics, performance indicators, and key HR metrics to help identify trends and insights within an organization.

## Dashboard Highlights
Attrition Analysis: Visual representation of employee attrition rates across different departments, job roles, and demographics.
Performance Metrics: Key performance indicators such as job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and employee engagement levels.
Demographic Insights: Analysis of employee demographics, including age, gender, marital status, and education level.
Employee Distribution: Visualization of employee distribution based on department, education field, and job role.
Methodology
Data Preparation
Synthetic Data Generation:

The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated using Python and the Faker library. The dataset includes columns such as Attrition, Department, Job Role, Education Field, Gender, Age, and various satisfaction metrics.
Data Cleaning:

The data was pre-processed to ensure consistency and accuracy. Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation techniques, and outliers were examined and treated as necessary.
Data Modeling:

The data was modeled in Tableau to create relationships between different tables and dimensions. Aggregations, calculations, and filters were applied to enable effective analysis.
Visualization and Analysis
Tableau Dashboard Creation:

Multiple dashboards were created in Tableau to visualize the data effectively. Interactive elements such as filters, parameters, and actions were used to enhance the user experience.
Key Visualizations:

Bar Charts: Used to compare categorical variables like department and job role with attrition rates.
Line Charts: Show trends over time for metrics like years at the company and performance rating.
Pie Charts: Display the distribution of employees by demographics such as gender and marital status.
Heat Maps: Highlight areas of high and low satisfaction across different departments.
Findings
Attrition Trends:

High attrition rates were observed in specific departments, particularly in Sales and Research & Development.
Employees in lower job levels and with less work-life balance tended to have higher attrition rates.
Satisfaction Metrics:

Environment satisfaction was generally higher among employees in managerial roles.
Job satisfaction varied significantly across departments, with some departments showing consistently lower satisfaction levels.
Demographic Insights:

A significant proportion of the workforce is concentrated in the 30-40 age band.
Gender distribution is fairly balanced across most departments, with slight variations in specific job roles.
Special Note
Synthetic Dataset:
The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated and does not represent real-world data. The data was created for educational and demonstration purposes only. While the synthetic data was designed to mimic typical HR datasets, it may not capture all the complexities of actual employee data.
